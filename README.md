# phomo1.github.io

* /js folder contains the JS for the responsive navbar;

* /includes contains the header.html for the site;

* /imgs contains the imgs for the pages;

NOTE: the image (us.JPG) in the index.html file must be at the main folder (outside of /imgs). For some reason, it won't load properly if it's inside a subfolder.

* All the html pages must be on the main folder. If they are inside a subfolder, the responsive navbar will not work.

* Do not delte the CNAME file -- it's responsible for redirecting to phomo.org

* To edit the navbar, go to /includes/header.html
