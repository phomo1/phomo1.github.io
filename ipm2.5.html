      <p>The Philosophy of Memory Organization is pleased to announce an online conference for
      Early Career Researchers, “Issues in Philosophy of Memory (IPM) 2.5”, July 12-16, 2021.
      Given the global pandemic and the lack of opportunities for in-person conferences, IPM 2.5
      is an opportunity for Early Career Researchers (graduate students, or researchers who are
      within five years of receiving their PhDs) to present their research in philosophy of memory.
      The conference will take place on Zoom, and each session will be chaired by an established
      researcher in the field, who will lead the discussion on the speakers’ talks.</p>

      <b>Invited chairs:</b><br />
      <br />
      Johannes Mahr (Harvard University)<br />
      Kourken Michaelian (Centre for Philosophy of Memory, Université Grenoble Alpes)<br />
      Sarah Robins (University of Kansas)<br />
      André Sant’Anna (Washington University in St Louis)<br />
