      <p>The Philosophy of Memory Organization is pleased to announce an online conference for Early Career Researchers, “Issues in Philosophy of Memory (IPM) 2.5”, July 12-16, 2021. </p>
				
      <p>Given the global pandemic and the lack of opportunities for in-person conferences, IPM 2.5
      is an opportunity for Early Career Researchers (graduate students, or researchers who are
      within five years of receiving their PhDs) to present their research in philosophy of memory.
      The conference will take place on Zoom, and each session will be chaired by an established
      researcher in the field, who will lead the discussion on the speakers’ talks.</p>
				
      <p>(IPM2.5 will bridge the gap following the postponement of IPM3, which was expected to take place in July 2021, but is now expected to take place in July 2022)</p>
	
	 Schedule [all times are CET (UTC+2)]; please note the earlier session time on Wednesday.
